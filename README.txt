README - Scheduler Simulation Assignment 2 - [COEN 346]

Goal : 

	We were tasked for the second assignment for COEN 346 to "simulate" a scheduler.

UPDATES : 

[02-25-2019 @ 11:38 PM] 

	Added Scheduler class.
	Also, added some working functions for the already existing classes.
	I also did a "simulation" of what the scheduler might do.

	- Doubts : 
		- Only for one user at the moment
		- The "run process" is not executing properly, since in reality, each tick of a run process should be == a cycle !
